## How It Works

**Input or Trigger** — The user provides a funnel template or a pre-configured campaign scenario. The system is triggered by either a scheduled time or an event-based action.

**Core Logic** — The funnel builder starts automating tasks like filling out forms, submitting data, tracking user movements, and calculating optimal paths using predefined rules.

**Output or Action** — Upon completion of each user step, results are recorded, and new tasks are generated based on funnel performance.

**Other Functionalities** — Real-time reporting and insights are generated based on user interactions with the funnel. Integrations with marketing platforms ensure synchronized updates.

**Safety Controls** — Auto-retries, logging of failed operations, and user alerts are implemented to maintain workflow integrity.
